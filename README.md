# Trial Version of Flush

Prior to developing the language learning app called "Flush," we have created a very simple CLI application using Python to verify if it seems to work well.

The concept is to support language acquisition by reviewing registered English sentences at appropriate intervals. In this trial version, we want to test the following two points:

1. Does it truly provide support for language acquisition?
2. What is the suitable frequency for reviewing the sentences?
